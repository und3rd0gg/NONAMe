"Furniture" contains subfolders "Chairs", "Tables" etc.

All materials use Marmoset Skyshop shaders by default, but standard Unity 3D shaders based
materials are also included. 
All "_PBR(Approx)" are Marmoset based materials
All "_Standard" are Unity 3D based materials
Both use same maps.

All Maps Are either x4096 (walls) or x2048 (all the rest).
A_Walls, B_Walls, C_Walls has alternative set of textures (damaged and dirty).

Please note simple rule: 1 resource folder - 1 set of textures. It is important if you are
want to use this pack for mobile applications. For example All "Models_B" use 1 set of textures, all "Furniture_1" also use 1 set of textures etc.
